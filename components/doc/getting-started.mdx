# Getting Started with Vulhub

Vulhub is an open-source collection of pre-built vulnerable docker environments. This guide will help you get started with using Vulhub for your security research and education.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started with Vulhub, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Installation

To get started with Vulhub, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/vulhub/vulhub.git

# Enter the directory
cd vulhub
```

## Using Vulnerable Environments

Each vulnerability in Vulhub is stored in its own directory. To use a specific vulnerability environment:

```bash
# Navigate to the vulnerability directory
cd vulhub/[application]/[vulnerability]

# Start the environment
docker compose up -d
```

### Example: Running a Spring Vulnerability

For example, to run the Spring CVE-2022-22947 vulnerability environment, navigate to the directory and start the environment:

```bash
# Navigate to the Spring CVE-2022-22947 directory
cd vulhub/spring/CVE-2022-22947

# Start the environment
docker compose up -d
```

## Common Useful Commands

Here are some essential Docker operations you'll need when working with Vulhub vulnerability environments:

### Checking Environment Status

Check if the vulnerable application is running properly:

```bash
docker compose ps
```

This shows you the status of all containers in the current vulnerability environment, including port mappings that you'll need to access the vulnerable service.

### Accessing a Container's Shell

For deeper investigation or to modify the vulnerable environment, you can enter the container's shell:

```bash
# Enter the container's shell
docker compose exec [container_name] bash
```

### Viewing Application Logs

Monitor application behavior during exploitation attempts:

```bash
# View real-time logs of the vulnerable application
docker compose logs -f

# View logs from a specific container
docker compose logs [container_name]
```

### Examining Web Server or Application Config

Inspect configuration files inside the container:

```bash
# Example: checking Apache config in a web container
docker compose exec web cat /etc/apache2/apache2.conf

# Example: viewing PHP configuration
docker compose exec web php -i
```

These operations will help you interact with the vulnerable environments, understand how they're configured, and assist in your exploitation and testing processes.

### Cleaning Up

When you're done with a vulnerability environment, you can stop and remove the containers:

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

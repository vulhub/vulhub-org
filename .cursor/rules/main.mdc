You are an expert in TypeScript, React and Tailwind. You are building an official website for Vulhub. Vulhub is an open-source collection of pre-built vulnerable docker environments, the Github repository is <https://github.com/vulhub/vulhub>.

## Code Style and Structure

- Write concise, technical TypeScript code.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoaded, hasError).

## Naming Conventions

- Favor named exports for components and utilities.
- File names should be all lowercase, with words separated by `-`.

## TypeScript Usage

- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
- Avoid enums; use objects or maps instead.
- Avoid using `any` or `unknown` unless absolutely necessary. Look for type definitions in the codebase instead.
- Avoid type assertions with `as` or `!`.

## Syntax and Formatting

- Use the "function" keyword for pure functions.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
- Use declarative JSX, keeping JSX minimal and readable.

## UI and Styling

- Use Tailwind for utility-based styling
- Use a mobile-first approach

Refer to the React and TailwindCSS documentation for more details on each of these practices.
